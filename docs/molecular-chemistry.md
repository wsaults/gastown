# Molecular Chemistry: Work Composition in Gas Town

> *"Work is fractal. Money is crystallized labor. Blockchain was the mechanism
> searching for its purpose."*

Gas Town is a **work composition and execution engine**. This document describes
the chemical algebra for expressing, instantiating, and executing work at any
scale - from single tasks to massive polymers that can grind through weekends
of autonomous operation.

**Core insight**: Structure is computation. Content is cognition. They're separate.

## The Work Lifecycle: Rig → Cook → Run

Gas Town work flows through three phases:

```
RIG ────→ COOK ────→ RUN
(source)  (artifact)  (execution)
```

| Phase | What Happens | Operator | Output |
|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Rig** | Compose formulas (source level) | `extends`, `compose` | Compound Formula |
| **Cook** | Instantiate artifacts | `cook`, `pour`, `wisp` | Proto, Mol, Wisp |
| **Run** | Execute steps | (agent execution) | Work done |

**Rig** is authoring time - writing and composing formula YAML files.
**Cook** is compile time - expanding macros, applying aspects, flattening to pure graphs.
**Run** is execution time - agents provide cognition for each step.

              Steps complete
              Work gets done
              Digests created
```

## Two Composition Operators

Gas Town has **two** composition operators at different abstraction levels:

| Operator | Level | Inputs | When to Use |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Rig** | Source | Formula + Formula | Authoring time, in YAML |
| **Bond** | Artifact | Proto/Mol/Wisp + any | Runtime, on cooked artifacts |

**Rig** composes formulas (YAML with `extends`, `compose`).
**Bond** composes artifacts (cooked protos, running mols/wisps).

This separation is key: rig for design-time composition, bond for runtime composition.

## The Steam Engine Metaphor

Gas Town is an engine. Engines do work and generate steam.

```
Claude = Fire (the energy source)
Claude Code = Steam Engine (harnesses the fire)
Gas Town = Steam Train (coordinates engines on tracks)
Beads = Railroad Tracks (the persistent ledger of work)
```

In our chemistry:
- **Formulas** are the secret recipe (source code for workflows)
- **Proto molecules** are the fuel (cooked templates, ready to instantiate)
- **Mols** are liquid work (flowing, dynamic, adapting as steps complete)
- **Wisps** are the steam (transient execution traces that rise and dissipate)
- **Digests** are the distillate (condensed permanent records of completed work)

## Formulas: The Source Layer

**Formulas** sit above protos in the artifact hierarchy. They're the source code -
YAML files that define workflows with composition operators.

```yaml
# shiny.formula.yaml - a basic workflow
formula: shiny
description: The canonical right way
version: 1
steps:
  - id: design
    description: Think carefully about architecture
  - id: implement
    needs: [design]
  - id: review
    needs: [implement]
  - id: test
    needs: [review]
  - id: submit
    needs: [test]
```

### Formula Composition (Rigging)

Formulas compose at the source level using `extends` and `compose`:

```yaml
# shiny-enterprise.formula.yaml
formula: shiny-enterprise
extends: shiny                    # Inherit from base formula
compose:
  - expand:
      target: implement
      with: rule-of-five          # Apply macro expansion
  - aspect:
      pointcut: "implement.*"
      with: security-audit        # Weave in cross-cutting concern
```

### Cooking: Formula → Proto

The `cook` command flattens a formula into a pure proto:

```bash
bd cook shiny-enterprise
# Cooking shiny-enterprise...
# ✓ Cooked proto: shiny-enterprise (30 steps)
```

Cooking pre-expands all composition - macros, aspects, branches, gates.
The result is a flat step graph with no interpretation needed at runtime.

### Formula Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **workflow** | Standard work definition | shiny, patrol |
| **expansion** | Macro template | rule-of-five |
| **aspect** | Cross-cutting concern | security-audit |

## The Three Phases of Matter

Work in Gas Town exists in three phases, following the states of matter:

| Phase | Name | State | Storage | Behavior |
|-------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Solid** | Proto | Frozen template | `.beads/` (template label) | Crystallized, immutable, reusable |
| **Liquid** | Mol | Flowing instance | `.beads/` | Dynamic, adapting, persistent |
| **Vapor** | Wisp | Ephemeral trace | `.beads-wisp/` | Transient, dissipates, operational |

### Proto (Solid Phase)

Protos or protomolecules are **frozen workflow patterns** - crystallized templates that
encode reusable work structures. They're the "molds" from which instances are cast.

Protos are stored as beads issues with `labels: ["template"]` and structured step data:

```yaml
# Example: shiny.formula.yaml (source) → cooked proto (beads)
formula: shiny
description: The canonical right way
version: 1
steps:
  - id: design
    description: Think carefully about architecture
  - id: implement
    needs: [design]
  - id: review
    needs: [implement]
  - id: test
    needs: [review]
  - id: submit
    needs: [test]
```

**Properties:**
- Considered immutable once cooked (frozen), though source formulas are editable
- Named (e.g., `shiny`, `rule-of-five`)
- Stored in permanent beads with `template` label
- Can be composed into larger protos via formula algebra (extends, compose)

### Mol (Liquid Phase)

Mols are **flowing work instances** - live executions that adapt as steps
complete, status changes, and work evolves.

**Properties:**
- Identified by head bead ID (e.g., `bd-abc123`)
- Dynamic - steps transition through states
- Persistent - survives sessions, crashes, context compaction
- Auditable - full history in beads

### Wisp (Vapor Phase)

Wisps are **ephemeral execution traces** - the steam that rises during work
and dissipates when done.

**Properties:**
- Stored in `.beads-wisp/` (gitignored, never synced)
- Single-cycle lifetime
- Either evaporates (burn) or condenses to digest (squash)
- Used for patrol cycles, operational loops, routine work

## Phase Transition Operators

Work transitions between phases through specific operators:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │     PROTO       │
                    │    (solid)      │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
              ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
              │              │              │
            pour           wisp         distill
              │              │              ↑
              ▼              ▼              │
      ┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐ │
      │      MOL      │  │     WISP      │ │
      │   (liquid)    │  │    (vapor)    │ │
      └───────┬───────┘  └───────┬───────┘ │
              │                  │         │
           squash             squash       │
              │                  │         │
              ▼                  ▼         │
      ┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐ │
      │    DIGEST     │  │  (evaporates) │ │
      │  (condensed)  │  │    or burn    │ │
      └───────────────┘  └───────────────┘ │
              │                            │
              └────────────────────────────┘
                       (experience crystallizes)
```

### Pour: Solid → Liquid

**Pour** instantiates a proto into a persistent mol - like pouring molten metal
into a mold to create a solid casting that will flow through the workflow.

```bash
bd pour mol-feature                    # Create mol from proto
bd pour mol-feature --var version=1.0  # With variable substitution
```

**Use cases:**
- Feature work that spans sessions
- Important work needing audit trail
- Anything you might need to reference later

### Wisp: Solid → Vapor (Sublimation)

**Wisp** instantiates a proto directly into vapor - sublimation that skips
the liquid phase for ephemeral, operational work.

```bash
bd wisp mol-patrol                     # Create wisp from proto
bd wisp mol-health-check               # Ephemeral operational task
```

**Use cases:**
- Patrol cycles (deacon, witness)
- Health checks and monitoring
- One-shot orchestration runs
- Routine operations with no audit value

### Squash: Liquid/Vapor → Condensed

**Squash** condenses work into a permanent digest - the outcome crystallizes
while the execution trace compresses or evaporates.

```bash
bd mol squash bd-abc123                              # Squash mol to digest
bd mol squash bd-abc123 --summary="Completed auth"   # With summary
```

**For mols:** Creates digest in permanent beads, preserves full outcome
**For wisps:** Creates digest, deletes wisp (vapor condenses to residue)

### Burn: Vapor → Nothing

**Burn** discards a wisp without creating a digest - the steam simply
evaporates with no residue.

```bash
bd mol burn wisp-123                   # Discard without digest
```

**Use cases:**
- Routine patrol cycles with nothing notable
- Failed attempts that don't need recording
- Test runs

### Distill: Liquid → Solid (Crystallization)

**Distill** extracts a reusable proto from an existing mol or epic - the
reverse of pour. Experience crystallizes into a template.

```bash
bd mol distill bd-abc123 --as "Release Workflow"
bd mol distill bd-abc123 --var feature=auth --var version=1.0
```

**Process:**
1. Analyze the existing work structure
2. Extract the pattern (steps, dependencies)
3. Replace concrete values with `{{variable}}` placeholders
4. Crystallize as a new proto

**Use cases:**
- Team develops a good workflow organically, wants to reuse it
- Capture tribal knowledge as executable templates
- Create starting points for similar future work

## The Polymorphic Bond Operator

**Bond** is Gas Town's polymorphic combiner for artifacts. It operates at the
artifact level (post-cooking), handling different operand types with phase-aware
behavior.

### The Bond Table (Symmetric)

| bond | Proto | Mol | Wisp |
|------|-------|-----|------|
| **Proto** | Compound Proto | Spawn Mol, attach | Spawn Wisp, attach |
| **Mol** | Spawn Mol, attach | Link via edges | Link via edges |
| **Wisp** | Spawn Wisp, attach | Link via edges | Link via edges |

The table is symmetric: bonding A+B produces the same structure as B+A.

**Bond** handles different operand types with different phase behaviors:

### Bond: Proto + Proto → Compound Proto

Two solid templates fuse into a larger solid template.

```bash
bd mol bond mol-review mol-deploy --as "Review and Deploy"
```

Creates a compound proto that includes both workflows. The result is a
reusable template (solid phase).

### Bond: Proto + Mol → Spawn + Attach

A solid template melts into an existing liquid workflow.

```bash
bd mol bond mol-hotfix bd-feature-123
```

The proto is instantiated (as liquid by default) and attached to the
existing mol. The new issues become part of the flowing work.

### Bond: Proto + Wisp → Spawn + Attach (Vapor)

A solid template sublimates into an existing vapor workflow.

```bash
bd mol bond mol-extra-check wisp-patrol-456
```

The proto spawns as vapor (following the wisp's phase) and attaches.

### Bond: Mol + Mol → Compound Mol

Two liquid workflows merge into a larger flowing structure.

```bash
bd mol bond bd-feature-123 bd-related-456
```

Links them via dependency edges. Both continue flowing.

### Bond: Wisp + Wisp → Compound Wisp

Two vapor traces merge into a larger ephemeral cloud.

```bash
bd mol bond wisp-123 wisp-456
```

### Phase Override Flags

Bond's spawning behavior can be overridden:

```bash
# Force liquid when attaching to wisp (found something important!)
bd mol bond mol-critical-bug wisp-patrol --pour

# Force vapor when attaching to mol (ephemeral diagnostic)
bd mol bond mol-temp-check bd-feature --wisp
```

| Flag | Effect | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| `--pour` | Force spawn as liquid | "This matters, persist it" |
| `--wisp` | Force spawn as vapor | "This is ephemeral, let it evaporate" |

### Cross-Phase Bonding

What happens when you bond liquid and vapor directly?

```bash
bd mol bond bd-feature-123 wisp-456    # Mol + Wisp
```

**Answer: Reference-only linking.** They connect via dependency edges but
stay in their respective stores. No phase change occurs - you're linking
across the phase boundary without forcing conversion.

This enables patterns like:
- Patrol wisp discovers issue → creates liquid mol for the fix
- Feature mol needs diagnostic → spawns vapor wisp for the check
- The reference survives even when the wisp evaporates (ID stable)

## Agent Attachment: Hooks and Pins

Agents need work attached to them. In Gas Town, this uses **hooks** and **pins**.

### The Hook

Each agent has a **hook** - an anchor point where work hangs. It's the
agent's "pinned bead" - the top of their inbox, the work they're focused on.

```bash
bd hook                                # Show what's on my hook
bd hook --agent deacon                 # Show deacon's hook
```

**Hook states:**
- **Empty (naked)**: Agent awaiting work assignment
- **Occupied**: Agent has work to execute
- **Multiple**: Agent managing several concurrent mols (rare)

### Pin: Attaching Work to Agents

**Pin** attaches a mol to an agent's hook - the action of assigning work.

```bash
bd pin bd-feature-123                  # Pin to my hook
bd pin bd-feature-123 --for witness    # Pin to specific agent's hook
bd unpin                               # Detach current work
```

**The Witness → Polecat flow:**

```bash
# Witness assigns work to polecat
bd pour mol-feature                    # Create liquid mol
bd pin bd-abc123 --for polecat-ace     # Hang on polecat's hook
gt nudge polecat-ace                   # Wake the polecat
```

### Wisps Don't Need Pinning

Wisps are single-cycle and don't survive session boundaries in the
traditional sense. Agents hold them in working memory for one cycle:

```bash
# Deacon self-spawns patrol (no pin needed)
bd wisp mol-deacon-patrol              # Create vapor
# ... execute steps ...
bd mol squash <id> --summary="..."     # Condense and dissipate
# Loop
```

## The Epic-Mol Relationship

Epics and mols are **isomorphic** but represent different mental models.

### Epic: The Business View

An epic is a **simple mol shape** - essentially a TODO list:

```
epic-root
├── child.1
├── child.2
├── child.3
└── child.4
(flat list, no sibling dependencies, execution order implicit)
```

**Properties:**
- One level of children via `.N` numbering
- No explicit serial/parallel encoding
- Human-readable, business-oriented
- The natural shape most humans create

### Mol: The Chemistry View

A mol is the **general case** - arbitrary graphs with explicit workflow
semantics:

```
mol-root
├── phase-A (epic)
│   ├── task.1 ───blocks──→ task.2 (serial)
│   └── task.3 (parallel with task.1)
├── phase-B (epic) ←───blocked-by─── phase-A
│   └── ...
└── standalone (fanout)
(arbitrary DAG, explicit dependencies encode serial/parallel)
```

**Properties:**
- Can contain multiple epics as subgraphs
- Dependency edges encode execution order
- `blocks` = serial (bottleneck)
- No dep = parallel (fanout)
- `conditional` = if-fail path

### The Relationship

**All epics are mols. Not all mols are epics.**

| Aspect | Epic | Mol |
|--------|------|-----|
| Shape | Flat (root + children) | Arbitrary DAG |
| Dependencies | Implicit in ordering | Explicit edges |
| Parallelism | Assumed parallel | Encoded in structure |
| Mental model | TODO list | Workflow graph |
| Common use | Simple feature work | Complex orchestration |

When you `distill` an epic, you get a simple proto.
When you `distill` a complex mol, you get a complex proto (preserving structure).

## Thermodynamic Properties

Gas Town's chemistry has thermodynamic properties - work is energy flowing
through the system.

### Work as Energy

```
Proto (potential energy) → Pour/Wisp → Mol/Wisp (kinetic energy) → Squash → Digest (stored work)
```

- **Protos** store potential energy - the capability to do work
- **Mols/Wisps** are kinetic - work actively flowing
- **Digests** are stored energy - crystallized outcomes

### The Audit Trail as Entropy

Every execution increases entropy - creating more history, more records,
more state. Gas Town manages this through:

- **Wisps**: High entropy, but evaporates (entropy contained)
- **Squash**: Compresses entropy into minimal digest
- **Distill**: Reduces entropy by extracting reusable pattern

### The CV Chain

Every agent has a **chain** of work - their CV:

```
Agent CV = ∑(digests) = crystallized capability proof
```

Work completed → digest created → agent's chain grows → capability demonstrated.

This is the foundation for capability-based work matching: your work
history IS your resume. The ledger speaks.

## The Complete Lifecycle

### Feature Work (Liquid Path)

```bash
# 1. Create work from template
bd pour mol-feature --var name=auth

# 2. Pin to agent
bd pin bd-abc123 --for polecat-ace

# 3. Agent executes steps
bd update bd-abc123.design --status=in_progress
# ... cognition ...
bd close bd-abc123.design
bd update bd-abc123.implement --status=in_progress
# ... and so on

# 4. Squash when complete
bd mol squash bd-abc123 --summary="Implemented auth feature"

# 5. Digest remains in permanent ledger
```

### Patrol Work (Vapor Path)

```bash
# 1. Self-spawn wisp (no pin needed)
bd wisp mol-deacon-patrol

# 2. Execute cycle steps
bd close <step-1>
bd close <step-2>
# ...

# 3. Generate summary and squash
bd mol squash <wisp-id> --summary="Patrol complete, no issues"

# 4. Loop
bd wisp mol-deacon-patrol
# ...
```

### Template Creation (Distillation)

```bash
# 1. Complete some work organically
# ... team develops release workflow over several iterations ...

# 2. Distill the pattern
bd mol distill bd-release-v3 --as "Release Workflow"

# 3. Result: new proto available
bd pour mol-release-workflow --var version=2.0
```

## Polymers: Large-Scale Composition

Protos can compose into arbitrarily large **polymers** - chains of molecules
that encode complex multi-phase work.

```bash
# Create polymer from multiple protos
bd mol bond mol-design mol-implement --as "Design and Implement"
bd mol bond mol-design-implement mol-test --as "Full Dev Cycle"
bd mol bond mol-full-dev mol-deploy --as "End to End"
```

**Polymer properties:**
- Preserve phase relationships from constituent protos
- Can encode hours, days, or weeks of work
- Enable "weekend warrior" autonomous operation
- Beads tracks progress; agents execute; humans sleep

### The Cognition Sausage Machine

A large polymer is a **cognition sausage machine**:

## The Proto Library

Gas Town maintains a **library of curated protos** - the fuel stockpile:

```
~/gt/molecules/
├── mol-engineer-in-box/       # Full quality workflow
├── mol-quick-fix/             # Fast path for small changes
├── mol-code-review/           # Pluggable review dimensions
├── mol-release/               # Release workflow
├── mol-deacon-patrol/         # Deacon monitoring cycle
├── mol-witness-patrol/        # Witness worker monitoring
└── mol-polecat-work/          # Standard polecat lifecycle
```

**Library operations:**

```bash
bd mol list                    # List available protos
bd mol show mol-code-review    # Show proto details
bd pour mol-code-review        # Instantiate for use
```

### Curated vs Organic

- **Curated protos**: Refined templates in the library, battle-tested
- **Organic protos**: Distilled from real work, may need refinement
- **Path**: Organic → refine → curate → library

## Digest ID Stability

When a wisp is created, its head bead ID is **reserved** in permanent storage.
This ensures cross-phase references remain valid:

```
1. bd wisp mol-patrol          → Creates wisp-123 (ID reserved)
2. bd mol bond ... wisp-123    → Reference created
3. bd mol squash wisp-123      → Digest takes same ID
4. Reference still valid       → Points to digest now
```

**Implementation:**
- On wisp creation: Write placeholder/tombstone to permanent beads
- On squash: Replace placeholder with actual digest
- Cross-phase references never break

## Dynamic Bonding: The Christmas Ornament Pattern

Static molecules have fixed steps defined at design time. But some workflows
need **dynamic structure** - steps that emerge at runtime based on discovered work.

### The Problem

Consider mol-witness-patrol. The Witness monitors N polecats where N varies:
- Sometimes 0 polecats (quiet rig)
- Sometimes 8 polecats (busy swarm)
- Polecats come and go during the patrol

A static molecule can't express "for each polecat, do these steps."

### The Solution: Dynamic Bond

The **bond** operator becomes a runtime spawner:

```bash
# In survey-workers step:
for polecat in $(gt polecat list gastown); do
  bd mol bond mol-polecat-arm $PATROL_WISP_ID \
    --var polecat_name=$polecat \
    --var rig=gastown
done
```

Each bond creates a **wisp child** under the patrol molecule:
- `patrol-x7k.arm-ace` (5 steps)
- `patrol-x7k.arm-nux` (5 steps)
- `patrol-x7k.arm-toast` (5 steps)

                     ⬣ base (cleanup)
```

The ornament **hangs from the Witness's pinned bead**. The star is the patrol
head (preflight steps). Arms grow dynamically as polecats are discovered.
The base (cleanup) runs after all arms complete.

### The WaitsFor Directive

A step that follows dynamic bonding needs to **wait for all children**:

```markdown
## Step: aggregate
Collect outcomes from all polecat inspection arms.
WaitsFor: all-children
Needs: survey-workers
```

The `WaitsFor: all-children` directive makes this a **fanout gate** - it can't
proceed until ALL dynamically-bonded children complete.

### Parallelism

Arms execute in **parallel**. Within an arm, steps are sequential:

```
survey-workers ─┬─ arm-ace ─┬─ aggregate
                │   (seq)   │
                ├─ arm-nux ─┤  (all arms parallel)
                │   (seq)   │
                └─ arm-toast┘
```

Agents can use subagents (Task tool) to work multiple arms simultaneously.

### The Activity Feed

Dynamic bonding enables a **real-time activity feed** - structured work state
instead of agent logs:

```
[14:32:01] ✓ patrol-x7k.inbox-check completed
[14:32:03] ✓ patrol-x7k.check-refinery completed
[14:32:07] → patrol-x7k.survey-workers in_progress
[14:32:08] + patrol-x7k.arm-ace bonded (5 steps)
[14:32:08] + patrol-x7k.arm-nux bonded (5 steps)
[14:32:08] + patrol-x7k.arm-toast bonded (5 steps)
[14:32:08] ✓ patrol-x7k.survey-workers completed
[14:32:09] → patrol-x7k.arm-ace.capture in_progress
[14:32:10] ✓ patrol-x7k.arm-ace.capture completed
[14:32:14] ✓ patrol-x7k.arm-ace.decide completed (action: nudge-1)
[14:32:17] ✓ patrol-x7k.arm-ace COMPLETE
[14:32:23] ✓ patrol-x7k SQUASHED → digest-x7k
```

This is what you want to see. Not logs. **WORK STATE.**

The beads ledger becomes a real-time activity feed. Control plane IS data plane.

### Variable Substitution

Bonded molecules support variable substitution:

```markdown
## Molecule: polecat-arm
Inspection cycle for {{polecat_name}} in {{rig}}.

## Step: capture
Capture tmux output for {{polecat_name}}.
```bash
tmux capture-pane -t gt-{{rig}}-{{polecat_name}} -p | tail -50
```

Variables are resolved at bond time, creating concrete wisp steps.

### Squash Behavior

At patrol end:
- **Notable events**: Squash to digest with summary
- **Routine cycle**: Burn without digest

All arm wisps are children of the patrol wisp - they squash/burn together.

### The Mol Mall

mol-polecat-arm is **swappable** via variable:

```markdown
## Step: survey-workers
For each polecat, bond: {{arm_molecule | default: mol-polecat-arm}}
```

Install alternatives from the Mol Mall:
- `mol-polecat-arm-enterprise` (compliance checks)
- `mol-polecat-arm-secure` (credential scanning)
- `mol-polecat-arm-ml` (ML-based stuck detection)

## Summary of Operators

| Operator | From | To | Effect |
|----------|------|------|--------|
| `pour` | Proto | Mol | Instantiate as persistent liquid |
| `wisp` | Proto | Wisp | Instantiate as ephemeral vapor |
| `bond` | Any + Any | Compound | Combine (polymorphic) |
| `squash` | Mol/Wisp | Digest | Condense to permanent record |
| `burn` | Wisp | Nothing | Discard without record |
| `distill` | Mol/Epic | Proto | Extract reusable template |
| `pin` | Mol | Agent | Attach work to agent's hook |

## Design Implications

### For Beads

1. **New commands**: `bd pour`, `bd wisp`, `bd pin`
2. **Flag changes**: `--persistent` → `--pour` (or phase follows operand)
3. **Wisp storage**: `.beads-wisp/` directory, gitignored
4. **Digest ID reservation**: Placeholder in permanent store on wisp creation

### For Gas Town

1. **Daemon**: Don't attach permanent molecules for patrol roles
2. **Deacon template**: Use `bd wisp mol-deacon-patrol` pattern
3. **Polecat lifecycle**: Consider wisp-based with digest on completion
4. **Hook inspection**: `bd hook` command for debugging

### For Agents

1. **Polecats**: Receive pinned mols, execute, squash, request shutdown
2. **Patrol roles**: Self-spawn wisps, execute cycle, squash, loop
3. **Recovery**: Re-read beads state, continue from last completed step
