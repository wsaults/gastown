{"id":"gb-8h1","title":"Support rig-specific beads databases in UI","description":"## Overview\n\nWhen a rig is selected in the RigFilter dropdown, the beads tab should fetch from that rig's beads database instead of town-level beads.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- Backend always queries town-level beads (`~/gt/.beads/`)\n- Frontend groups beads by rig AFTER fetching (cosmetic only)\n- RigFilter infrastructure exists but isn't used by BeadsList\n\n## Desired Behavior\n- When 'gastown_boy' rig selected → fetch from `~/Projects/Saults/gastown-boy/.beads/` (prefix: gb-)\n- When 'gastown' rig selected → fetch from `~/gt/gastown/.beads/`\n- When no rig selected → fetch from town-level beads (prefix: hq-)\n\n---\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Backend: beads-service.ts\n\n**File:** `backend/src/services/beads-service.ts`\n\n**Current code (lines 125-126):**\n```typescript\nconst townRoot = resolveTownRoot();\nconst beadsDir = resolveBeadsDir(townRoot);  // Always town-level\n```\n\n**Changes needed:**\n\nA. Update `ListBeadsOptions` interface (line 30-35):\n```typescript\nexport interface ListBeadsOptions {\n  rig?: string;      // existing - filters results\n  rigPath?: string;  // NEW - path to rig's beads database\n  status?: string;\n  type?: string;\n  limit?: number;\n}\n```\n\nB. Update `listBeads()` function:\n```typescript\nexport async function listBeads(options: ListBeadsOptions = {}): Promise\u003cBeadsServiceResult\u003cBeadInfo[]\u003e\u003e {\n  const townRoot = resolveTownRoot();\n  \n  // NEW: Use rig-specific beads dir if rigPath provided\n  let beadsDir: string;\n  if (options.rigPath) {\n    beadsDir = resolveBeadsDir(options.rigPath);\n  } else {\n    beadsDir = resolveBeadsDir(townRoot);\n  }\n  \n  // ... rest of function\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Backend: beads.ts route\n\n**File:** `backend/src/routes/beads.ts`\n\n**Add rig path resolution (before line 20):**\n```typescript\n// Map rig names to their beads directories\nconst RIG_PATHS: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e = {\n  'gastown_boy': '/Users/will/Projects/Saults/gastown-boy',\n  'gastown': '/Users/will/gt/gastown',\n  // Add more rigs as needed\n};\n\n// In the GET handler:\nconst rigPath = rig ? RIG_PATHS[rig] : undefined;\n\nconst result = await listBeads({\n  ...(rig \u0026\u0026 { rig }),\n  ...(rigPath \u0026\u0026 { rigPath }),  // NEW\n  ...(typeParam \u0026\u0026 { type: typeParam }),\n  status,\n  limit,\n});\n```\n\n**Alternative:** Make rig paths configurable via environment or config file.\n\n### 3. Frontend: BeadsList.tsx\n\n**File:** `frontend/src/components/beads/BeadsList.tsx`\n\n**Add import (near line 1-20):**\n```typescript\nimport { useRigFilter } from '../../contexts/RigContext';\n```\n\n**Add hook usage (near line 140):**\n```typescript\nconst { selectedRig } = useRigFilter();\n```\n\n**Update usePolling call (line 144-149):**\n```typescript\nconst {\n  data: beads,\n  loading,\n  error,\n  refresh,\n} = usePolling\u003cBeadInfo[]\u003e(\n  () =\u003e api.beads.list({ \n    status: statusFilter, \n    type: 'task', \n    limit: 50,\n    rig: selectedRig ?? undefined  // NEW: pass selected rig\n  }),\n  { interval: 30000, enabled: isActive }\n);\n```\n\n**Add selectedRig to refresh dependency (around line 175):**\n```typescript\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n  void refresh();\n}, [statusFilter, selectedRig, refresh]);  // Add selectedRig\n```\n\n---\n\n## Existing Infrastructure (No Changes Needed)\n\n- `RigContext.tsx` - Already provides `selectedRig` state\n- `RigFilter.tsx` - Already renders dropdown in header\n- `api.beads.list()` - Already accepts `rig` parameter\n- `bd-client.ts` - Already supports `BEADS_DIR` env var\n\n---\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Select 'gastown_boy' in RigFilter → should see gb-* beads\n2. Select 'gastown' in RigFilter → should see gt-* beads  \n3. Select 'All Rigs' → should see hq-* town beads\n4. Verify polling refreshes when rig selection changes\n\n---\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `backend/src/services/beads-service.ts` | Add rigPath option, resolve rig-specific beads dir |\n| `backend/src/routes/beads.ts` | Map rig names to paths, pass rigPath to service |\n| `frontend/src/components/beads/BeadsList.tsx` | Use useRigFilter, pass selectedRig to API |","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-16T19:16:04.997105-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-16T19:58:20.4845-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T19:58:20.484513-06:00","close_reason":"Closed","created_by":"mayor"}

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress?

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale.
