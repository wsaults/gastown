Mini Terminal Preview Window\nWhen attached to a gt tmux session, the tmux switch command shows a preview of other terminals. Investigate:\n- How can we achieve a similar effect in gastown_boy UI?\n- What would a mini terminal viewing window look like that shows the current state of an agent's tmux session?\n- Technical approaches (tmux capture-pane, PTY streaming, etc.)\n\n### 2. Agent Navigation Commands\nCheck if `gt next` and `gt prev` commands exist for cycling through agents:\n- Do these commands exist currently?\n- If not, would they be useful to implement?\n- Could these power PREV/NEXT navigation buttons in the UI?\n\n## Deliverable\nRecommend a solution with:\n- Technical approach for terminal preview\n- Whether to use/create gt next/prev commands\n- UI/UX suggestions for \u003c PREV and NEXT \u003e navigation","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"gastown_boy/polecats/ace","owner":"will@saults.io","created_at":"2026-01-16T10:11:43.412652-06:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-16T10:17:05.209539-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T10:17:05.209539-06:00","close_reason":"Closed","comments":[{"id":2,"issue_id":"hq-vwgc","author":"gastown_boy/polecats/ace","text":"## Research Findings\n\n### 1. gt next/prev Commands - DO NOT EXIST\n\nChecked the gt CLI - `gt next` and `gt prev` commands don't exist. The closest alternatives are:\n- `gt agents` - tmux popup menu for session switching (no cycling)\n- `gt polecat list` - list polecats\n\n**Recommendation:** These commands would be useful to implement. They could cycle through agents in a defined order (mayor → deacon → witness → refinery → polecats) and enable keyboard-driven navigation both in tmux and potentially in the web UI.\n\n### 2. Mini Terminal Preview - TECHNICAL APPROACHES\n\n#### Option A: Simple Pre-rendered Text (RECOMMENDED)\n- Use existing `gt peek \u003cagent\u003e` which wraps `tmux capture-pane`\n- Returns plain text (last N lines of terminal output)\n- Render in a `\u003cpre\u003e` element with monospace font\n- Pros: Simple, fast, no new dependencies\n- Cons: Static snapshot, no ANSI color support\n\n#### Option B: xterm.js (Full Terminal Emulation)\n- Industry-standard web terminal emulator (powers VS Code terminal)\n- GPU-accelerated, full ANSI/Unicode support\n- Pros: Rich rendering, handles colors/cursor positioning\n- Cons: Heavier (~200KB), overkill for read-only preview\n\n#### Option C: ansi-to-html + Pre\n- Lightweight ANSI escape code parser (~10KB)\n- Convert captured output to colored HTML\n- Pros: Preserves colors, minimal overhead\n- Cons: No cursor/interactive support\n\n### 3. Recommended Implementation\n\n**Phase 1: Static Preview Panel**\n1. Add backend endpoint: `GET /api/agents/:id/peek?lines=50`\n2. Call `gt peek \u003cagent\u003e -n 50` and return raw text\n3. Add expandable preview panel to AgentCard/AgentChip components\n4. Use `\u003cpre\u003e` with monospace font for initial render\n5. Add auto-refresh toggle (5-10 second polling when expanded)\n\n**Phase 2: PREV/NEXT Navigation (requires gt changes)**\n1. Implement `gt next` and `gt prev` commands in gastown\n2. Add navigation buttons to UI header or agent detail view\n3. Wire buttons to call new backend endpoints that invoke gt commands\n\n### 4. UI/UX Suggestions\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ [\u003c PREV]  AGENT: ACE (gastown_boy)  [NEXT \u003e]│\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ ┌─ TERMINAL PREVIEW ──────────────────────┐ │\n│ │ \u003e Running task: implement feature X...  │ │\n│ │ \u003e Editing file: src/foo.ts              │ │\n│ │ \u003e ...                                   │ │\n│ └─────────────────────────────────────────┘ │\n│ [REFRESH] [EXPAND] [ATTACH (opens tmux)]    │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n- Preview window shows ~10-20 lines by default\n- EXPAND button shows full scrollable view\n- ATTACH button could open tmux via URL scheme or show instructions\n","created_at":"2026-01-16T16:16:55Z"}]}
