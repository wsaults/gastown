Investigate:\n- How can we achieve a similar effect in gastown_boy UI?\n- What would a mini terminal viewing window look like that shows the current state of an agent's tmux session?\n- Technical approaches (tmux capture-pane, PTY streaming, etc.)\n\n### 2. Agent Navigation Commands\nCheck if `gt next` and `gt prev` commands exist for cycling through agents:\n- Do these commands exist currently?\n- If not, would they be useful to implement?\n- Could these power PREV/NEXT navigation buttons in the UI?\n\n## Deliverable\nRecommend a solution with:\n- Technical approach for terminal preview\n- Whether to use/create gt next/prev commands\n- UI/UX suggestions for \u003c PREV and NEXT \u003e navigation","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-16T10:11:43.412652-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-16T10:17:05.209539-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T10:17:05.209539-06:00","close_reason":"Closed","created_by":"mayor"}
